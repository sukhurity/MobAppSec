# MobAppSec
SDK to allow your mobile app to scan client mobile device to check for jailbroken/rooted phone, malware or tools. Block clients from trying to reverse engineer your app 
developers can secure their iOS and
Android customer-facing apps with an easy to integrate SDK. The SDK
effectively detects both known and unknown threats, including malicious
apps like keyloggers or banker malware that may be present on the device,
vulnerabilities in the operating system, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, or
tampering attempts to your mobile app. As a result, the application is able to
understand the environment in which it is operating, assess its risk, and
prevent compromise of data.
On-device capabilities enable the detection of device
vulnerabilities, including advanced jailbreak/root, vulnerable configurations,
iOS malicious profile detection, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, mobile malware
and tampering attempts. Cloud-based capabilities deliver malicious app
detection using advanced threat prevention technology, while ensuring that
resource intensive analytics are not taxing device performance. Advanced app
analysis includes static code flow analysis, dynamic analysis (application
sandboxing), and machine learning – all provided by Check Point’s Behavioral
Risk Engine (BRE).
